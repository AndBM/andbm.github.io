[Knud Rasmussen](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knud_Rasmussen) was a great Arctic explorer, and in honor of his exploits, a large swathe of land on the northern coast of Greenland was named after him. Looking at a modern map of Greenland, I was surprised to see much of what I knew as _Knud Rasmussen Land_ had become _Kronprins Frederik Land_. Not being able to find any clear explanations for what used to count as _Knud Rasmussen Land_, and what counted now, I decided to dig into the story and summarize it here for any curious souls.

A good reference to start with is a profile of Knud submitted to the journal Polar Record (Gilberg, 1984), which states that Knud Rasmussen land ranges “from _Melville Bay_ in the west to _Danmarks Fjord_ in the east“, see full quote in Fig. 1. This source might not be entirely accurate, however, as it mentions Knud receiving an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen, which is likely a case of the author mistaking Aberdeen for St. Andrews. However, if we look at a map (Gyldendal, 1988) from the same decade, this definition is supported, see Fig. 2.

_Melville Bay_ lies in the lower left of the map, while _Danmarks Fjord_ lies at the upper center, between _Mylius Erichsen Land_ and _Kronprins Christian land_.
However, in 2000 the Danish crown prince Frederik and the Sirius patrol, which enforces the sovereignty of Greenland and the Danish Realm, finished _Ekspedition Sirius 2000_. Upon arriving back at the airport in Copenhagen, the prince was greeted by the Prime Minister of Greenland, Jonathan Motzfeldt, who declared that a portion of Northern Greenland would now be named Kronprins Frederik land. He stated that it lay “next to _Knud Rasmussen Land_ ” (Ritzau, 2000), similar to the definition found in the Danish online lexicon Den Store Danske (Rasmussen, 2015), which states that _Kronprins Frederik Land_ is bordered by _Peary Land_ to the south (_sic_, but it must be to the north), _Kong Frederik VIII Land_ to the east, and _Knud Rasmussen land_ to the west. A current map of the area (Kortforsyningen, 2020) indicates that _Kronprins Frederik Land_ corresponds to what was previously the western half of _Knud Rasmussen Land_, running from _Danmarks Fjord_ to approximately _Wulff Land_.

So where is _Knud Rasmussen Land_? It would appear that it used to stretch from _Melville Bay_ in the west to _Danmarks Fjord_ in the east, but was reduced by half in 2000 to end at _Wulff Land_ in the east.
