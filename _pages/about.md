I am a theoretical physicist going on a deep dive into quantum mechanics with a focus on one-dimensional systems. My current research is on topological phases of matter, particularly the theory behind current attempts at finding anyons in the form of parafermionic zero modes. I am doing this in the context of my bi-national PhD degree under [Thomas Schmidt][1] at University of Luxembourg and [Bernd Braunecker][2] at University of St. Andrews, with my current location being Copenhagen.

I am also working as a researcher with the St Andrews [Centre for Energy Ethics][4], which among other things has resulted in an ongoing series of [blog posts][5] about the physical aspects of energy production.

I received my B.Sc. with distinction and M.Sc., both in physics, from Aarhus University in Denmark.

My other interests include programming and playing music, particularly the piano.

### Supercurrent-enabled Andreev reflection in a chiral quantum Hall edge state
Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are both examples of a macroscopic number of electrons exhibiting highly correlated behavior with very distinct transport signatures. When interfaced with a superconductor, the quantum Hall edge experiences induced superconducting pairing due to Andreev reflection, a process where electrons reflect off the superconductor as holes. It is expected that this type of system will be a good platform for hosting exotic quasiparticles with
significant impact on quantum computing.

Recent experimental observations of an s-wave superconductor inducing pairing into chiral edge states with parallel spins have led to the question: How can s-wave pairing between electrons with opposite spin and momenta be induced into a seemingly incompatible edge state where electrons have parallel spin and similar momenta? We develop a theoretical model showing that one must take spin-orbit coupling and screening current at the superconductor surface into account to find
pairing induced by electron tunneling between the two systems, providing critical understanding of the system as a platform for quasiparticles.

The full Hamiltonian of the system gives rise to an effective p-wave pairing Hamiltonian of the edge state, which elucidates the dependence of the pairing on the aforementioned surface phenomena. This Hamiltonian also allows analytical predictions for the transport phenomena used as signatures in experimental work, particularly the departures from the well-known zero longitudinal resistance of the quantum Hall effect. The model and its predictions will be useful in future experimental design, and are expected to be generalizable to the fractional quantum Hall effect.

### Current correlations of Cooper-pair tunneling into a quantum Hall system
The concept of a topologically protected quantum state, which can retain its quantum features under conditions where other systems would collapse, is immensely interesting for both theory and technology. A promising proposed host for such states is the hybrid system of a superconductor and a quantum Hall material. Previous research has shown that if these two are interface through a point contact, the Pauli principle suppresses the electron current between the two through the so-called Pauli blockade. In this paper we derive the current noise over the contact for 1D quantum Hall liquids with several filling fractions, as well as with and without electron-electron interactions.

### Ion-induced interactions in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
Current technology allows us to isolate a small number of atoms in an effectively one-dimensional trap, which is an excellent playground to explore quantum mechanics. But since the atoms are electrically neutral, they can be hard to control. Ions, on the other hand, are much easier to control. In our paper we demonstrate that in a mix of atoms and ions, tuning the ion states allows for a degree of control over the atom-atom interactions.
