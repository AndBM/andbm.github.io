I am a theoretical physicist going on a deep dive into quantum mechanics with a focus on one-dimensional systems. My current research is on topological phases of matter, particularly the theory behind current attempts at finding anyons in the form of parafermionic zero modes. I am doing this in the context of my bi-national PhD degree under [Thomas Schmidt][1] at University of Luxembourg and [Bernd Braunecker][2] at University of St. Andrews, with my current location being Luxembourg.

I received my B.Sc. with distinction and M.Sc., both in physics, from Aarhus University in Denmark.

My other interests include programming and playing music, particularly the piano.

## Publications
>Current technology allows us to isolate a small number of atoms in an effectively one-dimensional trap, which is an excellent playground to explore quantum mechanics. But since the atoms are electrically neutral, they can be hard to control. Ions, on the other hand, are much easier to control. In our paper we demonstrate that in a mix of atoms and ions, tuning the ion states allows for a degree of control over the atom-atom interactions.
