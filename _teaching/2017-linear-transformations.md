I ran exercise sessions in the 2nd year math course "Linear Transformations", challenging me to translate my theoretical understanding into pedagogical explanations. Part of the job was to participate in a workshop on how we could develop better exercise sessions. As a result of this workshop, I suggested a new model for exercise sessions, which was implemented with success in the course.
