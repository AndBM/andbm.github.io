I spoke at the [2019 TEDxUniversityOfLuxembourg][1] about a project on creating fractal poetry through simple Markov chains and linguistic software. 
This had been a spare time project for about half a year, the idea for which was inspired by [this book][2] (in Danish). 
Both the idea and the implementation were done side by side with the excellent linguist [Kasper Fyhn Jacobsen][3].
As part of the TEDx event, I was interviewed for [science.lu][4] (in French/German). The talk was recorded, and can be seen below.
