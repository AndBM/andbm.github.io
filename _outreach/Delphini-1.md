At Aarhus University, I was selected for the group of students tasked to build the university's first satellite, a proof-of-concept cubesat named [Delphini-1][1].
In that context, I wrote an article in Danish for the student magazine named [Dolphins in Space][2] about building the satellite, and recorded a fun little video about the process,
shown below.

On November 27th, 2020, the video had been watched 3747 times, to the great surprise of my collaborator, Andreas K. Dideriksen, and I!
